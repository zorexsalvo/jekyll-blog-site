This was originally posted on [dev.to](https://dev.to/zorexsalvo/zorex-salvo-junior-developer) as my introduction to the community.

I'm from the Philippines.


I have been coding professionally for a year now.


I am using Python/Django for most of the projects that I am doing.


Being an intern-to-working in a startup company, sparked the fire in me on being a developer.


We got to try everything full-stack. Though I am still digesting slowly all the knowledge that I am getting.


Before I went here, I was really empty-headed: no idea of bootsrap, frameworks.


So now, to get back all the time and knowledge that I have lost and wasted being in college, I get back to studying all the fundamentals.
