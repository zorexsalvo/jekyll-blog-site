*This was originally posted on [dev.to](https://dev.to/zorexsalvo/zorex-salvo-junior-developer) as my intro blog on dev.to community.*

I'm from the Philippines.


I have been coding professionally for a year now.


I am using Python/Django for most of the projects that I am doing.


Being exposed in the startup culture, I became fascinated with the whole tech community.
